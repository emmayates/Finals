		<h3>Step 1</h3>

		<p>For sunny-side-up eggs, start with a hot nonstick skillet on medium heat. Swirl in a little butter. Tip: Olive oil or bacon drippings will work great, too.</p>



		<h3>Step 2</h3>

		<p>Crack the eggs into individual bowls. This way you can inspect for broken shells and yolks.</p>

		<h3>Step 3</h3>

		<p>Add the eggs side by side in the pan.</p>

		<h3>Step 4</h3>

		<p>In about a minute, the outer edges will turn opaque. This is your cue to cover the pan and lower the heat. Tip: A lid traps the steam and gently cooks the top.</p>

		<h3>Step 5</h3>

		<p>Wait 4 minutes and you'll have perfect eggs â€” no sticking or breaking. The longer you cook the eggs, the harder the yolk will be. If you want a medium yolk, cook for 5 minutes. A hard yolk will set in 6. Tip: Fresher eggs are best since the whites are firm and hold their shape better. Hit them with salt and pepper to taste and that's it!</p>

		<h3>Option for Easy Over</h3>

		<p>If you like your eggs over easy, start as with sunny-side-up eggs, then flip the eggs when the outside whites set. Cook for about a minute on this side. Tip: Use a confident, gentle motion when flipping. Get under the edge with the spatula, then flip it.</p>

		<h3>Step 7</h3>
